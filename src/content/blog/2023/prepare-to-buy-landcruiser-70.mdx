## The origin of the Land Cruiser 70 series

As you know, Land Cruiser has many histories. The first Land Cruiser was released in 1951.

The origin of the Land Cruiser 70 series is the BJ model. BJ model was used for the military and is very strong and durable because this model as named Toyota Jeep BJ was created for accepting the order from the US military and police.

The name as Jeep was used for indicating the four-wheel-drive car in Japan at that time.
BJ originated from the name of the engine which is a water-cooled inline 6-cylinder 3.4L(3,386 CC) OHV engine and B type engine and J type chassis.

A counterpart of the BJ model is Mitsubishi Jeep J3/J3R. Mitsubishi Jeep J3/J3R and Nissan Patrol 4W60 as same as BJ were created for accepting the order from the police.

However, BJ was not selected for police and Mitsubishi Jeep J3/J3R was selected.

But BJ has achieved the climbing performance of 60% of Mt. Fuji. It was a very high performance at that time, and as a result, BJ was selected for the patrol car of the National Police, an advancement of the police.

The name "Jeep" was later changed to "Land Cruiser" in June 1954 after the name "Jeep" conflicted with William's trademark rights.

The legend of the Land Cruiser that continues to this day began. Today, it is Toyota's longest-used vehicle name.
